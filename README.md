# TrialAgent: A Self-Driving Clinical Lab

**Ayush Noori**

Artificial intelligence (AI) offers unprecedented opportunities to understand disease biology, repurpose existing drugs ([Zitnik, 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03233-x)), and advance towards novel therapeutics for complex diseases ([Zitnik, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03832-2)). For example, there is an active effort underway to create "virtual cell" models, or computational models that simulate the functions and reactions of the cell ([Bunne, 2024](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674\(24\)01332-1)). These models aim to predict responses to drugs, including small-molecule and genetic perturbations ([Adduri, 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.26.661135v2)), setting the stage for "*in silico* clinical trials" ([Gandhi, 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.23.683759v1); T[ahoe Team, 2025](https://www.tahoebio.ai/news/tahoe-x1-blog)). However, current virtual cell efforts suffer from a knowledge gap: they are currently trained largely on gene expression data, which captures only one modality, often at only one time point, and within a limited repertoire of perturbations, cell types, or other contexts. Moreover, even if we are successfully able to recapitulate the behavior or responses of a single cell, the therapeutic insights gleaned may not translate to the level of tissues or the whole human organism.

Alternatively, some of the critical missing data signals in modeling whole human responses to external factors in health and disease can be recovered through analyses of real-world, population-scale observational health data. Prospective analyses, in the form of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), are the gold standard for validating therapeutic hypotheses; however, they are lengthy, expensive, and challenging to conduct. Where RCTs are resource-prohibitive, retrospective analyses, known as real-world evidence (RWE) studies, can be performed on electronic health records (EHRs) or other types of real-world data (RWD) routinely collected during healthcare delivery to derive signals about the "benefits or risks of medical products" ([Concato and Corrigan-Curay, 2022](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2200089); [U.S. FDA, 2025](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-resources/advancing-real-world-evidence-program)). However, RWE is often still difficult to collect: due to the intricacies of structured data curation and harmonization, cohort design, causal modeling, and appropriate correction for confounding factors, there exist standalone papers for individual emulated RCTs. Approaches such as TRIALSCOPE ([González, 2025](https://ai.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/AIoa2400859)) structure clinical text at scale to facilitate target trial emulation; however, there still does not exist a unified platform capable of:
1.  Automatically and scalably extracting RWE from structured RWD.
2. Adaptively learning from RWE to propose, design, and execute new causal experiments.
3. Extend beyond predicting "benefits or risks of medical products" to connect these macroscopic clinical insights back to the molecular scale.

Here, we propose TrialAgent, an AI agent-based self-driving clinical lab. The experiments TrialAgent conducts are not with pipettes, robotics, or embodied systems; rather, TrialAgent performs emulated target trials, survival analyses, and other retrospective exposure-outcome cohort studies. Unlike previous tools (*e.g.*, TRIALSCOPE), which act as assistants for human-designed trials, TrialAgent is an autonomous investigator capable of designing, executing, and interpreting thousands of emulated trials to generate new biological hypotheses. Importantly, TrialAgent integrates RWE with molecular and cellular data – including drug interactions, mechanisms of action, protein-protein interactions, and cellular organization – from biomedical knowledge graphs (*e.g.*, OptimusKG) to identify new drug targets and suggest new mechanisms of disease pathology based on signals from RWE.

TrialAgent serves as the macroscopic counterpart to the microscopic virtual cell. By linking molecular mechanisms (via KGs) to population-level outcomes (via RWE), we create a closed-loop system for biological discovery grounded in human health.
